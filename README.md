## üìÅ Repository Overview

The repository includes the following components:

### 1. **Health Medical Chatbot**
   - **Description**: An intelligent chatbot application built using **Streamlit** and **LangChain** to answer medical queries. It leverages advanced document retrieval techniques to fetch and process data from uploaded documents, URLs, or a default medical document.
   - **Technologies Used**: 
     - **LangChain** for embedding and retrieval.
     - **FAISS** for vector storage.
     - **ChatGroq** for language model interactions.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Upload PDFs or input a URL to retrieve relevant information.
     - Ask health-related questions and receive AI-powered answers.

### 2. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
   - **Description**: Contains projects focused on **image generation** using GAN architectures like **DCGAN** and **CycleGAN**.
   - **Technologies Used**: 
     - TensorFlow
   - **Use Cases**:
     - Image synthesis and domain translation.

### 3. **LangChain Experiments**
   - **Description**: Experiments and projects with LangChain to explore document embedding, retrieval, and LLM-based question answering.
   - **Technologies Used**: LangChain, FAISS, LLMs.
   - **Use Case**: Embedding-based document retrieval and AI-driven conversational systems.

### 4. **Movie Recommendation System**
   - **Description**: A recommendation engine that suggests movies using collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.
   - **Technologies Used**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy.
   - **Key Features**: Personalized movie recommendations.

### 5. **Assignments**
   - **Siddharth_jindal.pdf**: A Python assignment in PDF format.
   - **Siddharth_jindal_thapar_institute.pdf**: A machine learning assignment in PDF format.
   - **Siddharth_jindal.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook for machine learning experiments.
